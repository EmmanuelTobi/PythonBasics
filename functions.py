#functions help in holding the result for the computing of values or any action on a string
#multiple functions can be coded in a single python file and all of them can be called differently
#and used anytime.

def to_muiltiply(a, b): #creating a function with just two inputs, more can be added.
    c = a * b
    return c #the function then returns a value on the computed actions done

#using the function
print (to_muiltiply(5, 6)) #output: 30
